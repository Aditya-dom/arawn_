**Short Experience of Quant**

If you're an Indian engineering undergrad, then everything below is for you::if you want to become a Quant.

> Before getting started, I just want to say one thing:

<blockquote data-theme="dark" class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Everyone knows that to do great work you need both natural ability and determifuckination. but there&#39;s a third Ingredients(Garam Masala) that&#39;s not as well Understood: an obsessive interest in a particular topic.</p>&mdash; Arawn (@arawn_10) <a href="https://twitter.com/arawn_10/status/1938260566193082590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So if you're choosing Quant, be passionate; about programming, equations, theory, models, economics... and of course, sell the news, buy the profit.
A good quant must be a mixture; part trader, part mathematician, part programmer, and part salesperson.

Just study Mathematics 1, 2, and 3 taught in almost every Indian engineering institute. I’m not aware of exceptions, but honestly, M1,M2, M3 are more than enough to kickstart your Quant journey.

Then, on your own, start learning how financial models work in the fintech industry. Understand everything; from why we need markets, demand::supply dynamics, long;term investing, intraday, overnight futures… every basic to advanced concept.
This is crucial, not just for being a Quant but also for managing and growing your own money. Financial literacy is a must, Quant or Mechanical Engg., doesn’t matter.

Start low::level. Pick one: Rust, C++, OCaml; anything you vibe with. And yeah, I know everyone reading this already knows Python::so start building stuff with Python. Speculate on orderbooks, charts, models, Agents, MCPs.
**Talk about money.**

Once you’ve done all this, and you still feel like “yeah, I want to be a Quant,”now start learning Machine Learning. Build models. Test strategies. Run simulations. Study the outputs. Tweak. Repeat.

Then, explore other asset classes; Commodities, Forex, Fixed Income, Crypto.

Start reading research papers; line by line and blogs. You’ll start connecting dots. Don’t hesitate to ask questions. we can’t afford mistakes in this game. Markets are volatile. Unforgiving.

I personally like Crypto; because [DeFi](https://www.youtube.com/embed/41JCpzvnn_0?list=PLU52pNodXIGdM6XDgHVG7DsPytlsrR_6b) opened new doors in the world of finance.

Once you're here, start trading with your own little capital. That’s when you’ll really taste the game; no matter what asset class you’re into.

That’s it.

I’ll drop some resources below.
