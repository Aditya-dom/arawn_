# About
I currently wear multiple hats across Maths/Blockchain/Quant/ML at [Quranium](https://quranium.org/) and Building [**Timelock**](https://timelock.trade) on-chain option protocol 1000x leverage without liquidation (Zero Liquidation) also working on the idea of non-liquidatable yield protocol. These days I am generally interested in Crypto HFT Market Making, Low Latency Code specifically using Rust, Hardware (FPGA, NIC etc), Quant, ML, Blockchain and specifically the application of ML to unsolved problems in DeFi world, Quantitative Finance and integration of ML and Blockchain!

I also hold an honorary  **__Bug Hunter__**  tag for finding vulnerabilities in Snapchat & Uber. In past lives, I previously wore the same multitude of hats at [**Yield.fi**](https://yield.fi) as DeFi/Quant Strategist(on-chain Strategies), [Blockhouse](https://blockhouse.app/) as Quant Researcher beyond that and doing my B.Tech at the [**Institute of Engineering and Technology**](https://www.ietlucknow.ac.in/).

**In my work, I’m probably best known for two things:**

Open-source software; in particular, in the Rust and Quantitative ecosystems. See my [**software page**](https://arawn.tech/) and my [**GitHub page**](https://github.com/Aditya-dom).

When I’m not staring at code, I find joy in playing cricket, hanging out with my dog, crafting melodies with my guitar, sculpting my physique at the gym, or probably be found on a solo trip.

I still do some academic work on the side; feel free to contact me with collaboration requests.
