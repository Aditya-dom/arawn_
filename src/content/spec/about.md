# About
I wear multiple hats across Maths/Quant/Blockchain/ML. DeFi Engineer at [Quranium](https://quranium.org/). Currently building [**Timelock**](https://timelock.trade): an on-chain options protocol with 1000x leverage and zero liquidation (oracle free) and also exploring idea of non-liquidatable yield protocol. 
My core interests these days: Crypto HFT market making, low-latency Rust Programming, Hardware, Computer Architectures, MEV.

I also hold an honorary  **__Bug Hunter__**  tag for finding vulnerabilities in Snapchat & Uber. In past lives, I previously wore the same multitude of hats at [**Yield.fi**](https://yield.fi) as DeFi/Quant Strategist(on-chain Strategies), [Blockhouse](https://blockhouse.app/) as Quant Researcher beyond that and doing my B.Tech at the [**Institute of Engineering and Technology**](https://www.ietlucknow.ac.in/).

**In my work, I’m probably best known for two things:**

Open-source software; in particular, in the Rust and Quantitative ecosystems. See my [**software page**](https://arawn.tech/) and my [**GitHub page**](https://github.com/Aditya-dom).

When I’m not staring at code, I find joy in playing cricket, hanging out with my dog, crafting melodies with my guitar, sculpting my physique at the gym, or probably be found on a solo trip.

I still do some academic work on the side; feel free to contact me with collaboration requests.
