# About
I currently wear multiple hats across Maths/ML/Quant at [**Valley Town**](https://valleytowncapital.com/) & [Finzie](https://www.getfinzie.com/). These days I am generally interested in Quant ML, and specifically the application of ML to unsolved problems in Quantitative Finance!

I also hold an honorary  **_Bug Hunter_**  tag for finding vulnerabilities in Snapchat & Uber. In past lives, I previously wore the same multitude of hats at [**Density Exchange**](https://density.exchange/), [**Refonte Infini**](https://www.refonteinfini.com/), and [**Afame Technologies**](https://afame.in/), and doing my B.Tech at the [**Institute of Engineering and Technology**](https://www.ietlucknow.ac.in/).

**In my work, I’m probably best known for two things:**

Open-source software; in particular, in the Rust and Quantitative ecosystems. See my [**software page**](https://arawn.live/) and my [**GitHub page**](https://github.com/Aditya-dom).

When I’m not staring at code, I find joy in playing cricket, hanging out with my dog, crafting melodies with my guitar, sculpting my physique at the gym, or probably be found on a solo trip.

I still do some academic work on the side; feel free to contact me with collaboration requests.
